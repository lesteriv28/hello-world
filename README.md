# hello-world
A little bit about me and what I am hoping to contribute and get out of Github.
I am a 22 yo, Panamenian Engineering student. I have a huge love for tech and my passion pushes me to learn new things everyday.
I love dogs, tacos and noodles. I love meeting new people and I always challenge myself to crack a smile from them.
